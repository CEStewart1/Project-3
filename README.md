## Contributions
As the sole technical writer for the Hadron project, I was responsible for copyediting Hadron’s legacy documents, which included maintaining consistency across the documentation and establishing clear quality standards. During the copyediting process, I used Markdown markup language and stored all documentation in a Git repository. The final rendered files are now published and accessible on Codeberg.org.  

One key deliverable included copyediting the **Developer Guide** shown above. The *Developer Guide* was designed to help new contributors effectively engage with the project. This guide provides developers with a clear outline of the contributor workflow, project file structure, issue reporting, licensing rules, and more.

## Challenges
Before my contributions, the project’s legacy documentation suffered from inconsistent language, a lack of contributor-friendly guidance, and writing inconsistencies. In addition, I overcame content-related challenges while working with **Codeberg.com**, as the platform is not widely used in the industry.

## Results
By standardizing the language and improving clarity, I transformed the documentation into a reliable resource that actively supports the developer community. The improved *Developer Guide*:  

- Reduced onboarding time  
- Minimized errors caused by unclear instructions  
- Established a professional standard for future documentation  

In short, I helped turn the documentation from a barrier into an asset — saving the team time, increasing contributor confidence, and setting the project up for long-term success.
